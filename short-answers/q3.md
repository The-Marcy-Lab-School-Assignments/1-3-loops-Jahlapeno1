# Question
Look at this function:

```js
const bailOut = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i > 3) return;
    console.log('Inside the loop', i);
  }
  console.log('Outside the loop');
};
```

Is that `console.log('Outside the loop');` ever going to run? Why or why not?

# Answer
The `console.log('Outside the loop')` will not run because the functions stops once `i` becomes greater than 3 due to the return statement.

# Teacher Feedback

Just want to reiterate that the return keyword causes the function to stop. The return keyword is triggered when `i` is greater than 4. Great job! I also love the use of markdown!
